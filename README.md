# Advent of Code 2024

Fortran 77 on RaspberryPi OS (Debian bookworm)

Use (with gfortran installed) f77 filename.f -o filename to compile and link.

## Notes

Day 2 answers use the XOR intrinsic (generates a warning message from the compiler), which is not part of the f77 standard but is widely implemented.
